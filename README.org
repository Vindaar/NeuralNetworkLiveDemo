* MNIST classification live demo

[[file:media/demo.gif]]

This repository contains (will contain) a simple demo showcasing
training of a simple MLP on the MNIST (insert link) dataset.

This demo is part of a talk given at the BCGS weekend seminar in Bad
Honnef on <2018-05-26 Sa> (insert link).

The basic idea is the following:
- train MLP using arraymancer (insert link)
- after each epoch (or more or less often?) take (some?) random digit,
  classifiy
- use plotly to plot sample as heatmap on the fly, including
  prediction of network of that sample

** Breakdown of repo / project
- ann_talk.org
  is the (probably rushed?! :/) talk I will be giving

The demo consists of 2 different programs, a client and a server. The
server performs the actual training using Arraymancer. The client is
only used to plot the data. It uses nim-plotly (based on plotly.js)
for that.

*** Client
Since nim-plotly by default uses the =C= backend by default, some work
had to be done to be able to produce live updating plots. Using a
static template.html does not easily allow to call =Plotly.react= to
replace the content of the plot. Therefore, we use an experimental JS
backend for nim-plotly and call =newPlot= as well as =react= from
that. But because we cannot train the MLP using the JS backend, we
need to split the two into individual programs.
The communication between the two happens using WebSockets, with the
data being sent as stringified JSON.

Note that this depends on the =nim-plotly/exp_js_backend= branch here:
[[https://github.com/vindaar/nim-plotly/tree/exp_js_backend]].
